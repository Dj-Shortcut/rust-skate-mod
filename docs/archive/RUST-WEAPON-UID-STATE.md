# Weapon UID gunplay state

Source slice of [the full mod](../SKATE-MOD.md), [#312](https://github.com/Dj-Shortcut/mw2-rust-rust-rewrite/issues/312), part of [#275](https://github.com/Dj-Shortcut/mw2-rust-rust-rewrite/issues/275).
C#7.3 [source](../../mods/rust/shared/WeaponUidState.cs) and [net48 project](../../mods/rust/shared/WeaponUidState.csproj) use the [gunplay](RUST-GUNPLAY-CORE.md) API.
Source compiled against genuine Rust references; scoped actual-DLL verification passed.

## Fixed roster

Create once per host-issued life lease from 0–64 unique positive weapon UIDs.
Copy immutable GunStates at one host tick; retain their profiles and state.
No enrollment, removal, transfer, profile replacement, restart or packet reset.
Reject malformed/excess bindings without eviction. Lease IDs are host fences.

## Tick and selection

Only the exact next host tick is accepted; supply complete trusted ammo observations.
Selected UID is an already confirmed physical fact; zero means no weapon.
Reconcile all UIDs through Gunplay; begin equip on a confirmed selection change.
From that common original-tick baseline, stage separate action and fallback branches.
Tick every UID once. Only the selected UID receives already-gated input and pose.
All other UIDs, and all fallback UIDs, receive no input and Unavailable mode.
Fallback never starts from an already advanced candidate.
Both branches retain confirmed selection, including its equip/release requirements.

## Publication

One opaque `WeaponUidCandidate` binds owner, epoch, original snapshot and tick.
Read `Current`/`TryGetState`; stage with `TryPrepare` before native effects.
Settle with `TryPublishApplied` or `TryPublishRejectedNoEffects` only after host confirmation.
Applied publishes action; confirmed zero effects publishes fallback at the same tick.
Foreign, stale, repeated and overlapping work publishes nothing.
`Invalidate` closes permanently for unknown/partial effects; no restart/reconciliation API.
Historical states and candidate outputs authorize no native effect.

## Adapter and evidence limits

The adapter fences ownership/stock, [Rider](RUST-RIDER-CONTROLS.md), effects and settlement.
It closes both coordinators when effects or settlement become ambiguous.
Fresh stock/selection changes after preparation require closure and native read-back.
Reserve is an observed count: weapons can share it; never sum or allocate it.
Only the selected weapon may request ammo changes; native stock must be revalidated.
Source locks do not prove native/Rider atomicity, authentication or inventory ownership.
Actual net48/C#7.3 builds: SDK8.0.425, genuine Rust mscorlib, zero warnings/errors.
Mac net8 consumer of those exact production DLLs: 16 cases,25,923 assertions,exit0.
Checks cover switching, stock, fallback, stale candidates, Rider composition and races.
All source/reference/production/copy-local hashes preserved; source boundary only.
No permanent tests, probes or binaries ship. Native ammo/firing, inventory lifecycle,
client presentation, loader, server integration and complete two-client play remain open.
